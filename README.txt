Setup Instructions
------------------------
1) Detailed instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
  - I used expo cli, very fast to set up and easy to view app on own android device, or in browser on pc.
2) Various modules to install using 'npm install ...' then 'expo install ...' in terminal, I will list the ones I can remember so please add any others to this list:
  - @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
  - react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons
  - @react-navigation/stack
3) Run command 'npm start' in code folder to run local server. Debugging and testing can be done on your own android device using the app 'Expo Go'.
  Alternatively, can load as website in browser, but with less error messages and harder to debug.
